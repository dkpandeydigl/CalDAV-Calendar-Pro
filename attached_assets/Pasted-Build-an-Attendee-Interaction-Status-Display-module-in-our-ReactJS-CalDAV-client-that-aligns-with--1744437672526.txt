Build an Attendee Interaction & Status Display module in our ReactJS CalDAV client that aligns with CalDAV/iTIP (RFC 5545 & RFC 5546) standards.

üéØ Part 1: Attendee Response UI (RSVP Interface)
User Interface:
Section title: ‚ÄúGoing?‚Äù

Three RSVP buttons:

Yes ‚Üí PARTSTAT=ACCEPTED

No ‚Üí PARTSTAT=DECLINED

Maybe ‚Üí PARTSTAT=TENTATIVE

Propose a new time button:

Opens datetime pickers for start/end suggestion

Add a note button:

Opens a rich-text editor (WYSIWYG) for writing a message

Support tags like {{organizer_name}}, {{start_time}} to be replaced with actual values

Include ‚ÄúPreview‚Äù button to show the note with tag values replaced

Submit Response button:

Sends RSVP with note and optional time proposal

Option to expand the whole section into full-screen modal for better UX

Backend Behavior:
Fetch the original event using UID

Construct an iTIP REPLY object (RFC 5546 compliant)

Update ATTENDEE with new PARTSTAT

Include COMMENT field with the attendee‚Äôs note

If proposing new time, add custom props like X-PROPOSED-START and X-PROPOSED-END

Update DTSTAMP and increment SEQUENCE

Send this as part of CalDAV update and also via emails

üßæ Part 2: Attendee Status Display (Organizer View)
In Event View Mode:
Show all attendees and their current response status in a clear list or table

Status icons or indicators:

‚úÖ Accepted

‚ùå Declined

‚ùì Tentative

‚è≥ No Response

Display the note/comment if one was submitted by the attendee

If the user is the organizer, optionally allow them to accept/reject proposed new times (optional extension)

Data Binding:
Read from the ATTENDEE block in the VEVENT

Match user emails to response status (PARTSTAT)

If available, include COMMENT and custom fields (X-*)

üß† Notes:
Use a clean, responsive design (Tailwind or Bootstrap preferred)

Rich text editor can be Quill or Tiptap

Template tags system should be flexible (suggest using {{ }} syntax with a replacement function)
