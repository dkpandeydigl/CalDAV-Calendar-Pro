Enhance the ReactJS CalDAV client with a feature that previews an event before it's created when attendees are involved.

ðŸŽ¯ Feature: Event Preview + Mail Option
Implement the following functionality:

Event Preview Page:

When a user creates an event and adds one or more attendees, instead of immediately creating the event, show a preview screen.

Display all event details: title, description, time, location, recurrence (if any), and a list of attendees with their roles.

Provide two buttons:

"Send Mail & Create Event"

"Create Event Only"

Send Mail & Create Event:

If this option is selected:

Send an email invitation to each attendee using an SMTP configuration provided by the user.

Use the iCalendar .ics format in the email as a MIME attachment (content-type: text/calendar; method=REQUEST).

The email should contain a readable invitation message and the .ics content for the calendar event.

Then proceed to create the event on the CalDAV server using the PUT method as per the CalDAV standard.

Create Event Only:

Skip the email process.

Proceed directly to event creation using CalDAV PUT.

SMTP Config:

Assume the user has provided SMTP configuration (host, port, username, password, from address) through a secure settings page or form.

Use Node.js backend (or a backend proxy if running in Replit) to securely send the email using a package like nodemailer.

Security:

Do not expose SMTP credentials in frontend.

Ensure SMTP calls are made from a secure backend function or API route (ExpressJS recommended).

Optional Enhancements:

Show a toast notification or modal once the mail is sent and the event is created.

Add loading indicators for both sending mail and creating events.

Log or display any SMTP or CalDAV errors in a user-friendly way.

Component Design:

EventPreviewPage: takes event object as props, renders a clean summary of the event, with two action buttons.

sendMailToAttendees(event, smtpConfig): function (in backend) that builds the .ics, prepares the mail body, and sends it using nodemailer.

createCalDAVEvent(event): function that handles the CalDAV PUT logic.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: ReactJS

Backend (if needed): Node.js with Express

Mail: Nodemailer (SMTP)

Calendar Event Format: iCalendar VEVENT with attendees (ATTENDEE: lines)
