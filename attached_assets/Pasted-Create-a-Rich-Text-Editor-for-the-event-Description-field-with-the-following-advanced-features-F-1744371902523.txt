Create a Rich Text Editor for the event Description field with the following advanced features:

✅ Features to Implement
Rich Text Editing

Use TipTap for best UX and flexibility.

Support: Bold, Italics, Underline, Lists, Links, Headings.

Tag Insertion

Use {{tag_name}} format for inserting dynamic fields.

Available Tags:

{{attendee_name}}

{{organizer_name}}

{{event_date}}

{{start_time}}

{{location}}

{{meeting_link}}

Implement an “Insert Tag” dropdown that adds the tag at the current cursor position in the editor.

Template Support

Add a dropdown to insert predefined templates.

Templates are basic rich text snippets (e.g., meeting invite text).

When a template is selected, insert it into the editor.

Live Preview Mode

Add a toggle button: Preview ✨ / Edit 📝

In preview mode:

Show rendered HTML

Replace {{tag}} with actual values using a placeholder object

Example replacement object:

js
Copy
Edit
{
  attendee_name: "D K Pandey",
  organizer_name: "Ajay Data",
  event_date: "2025-04-12",
  start_time: "10:00 AM",
  location: "Board Room",
  meeting_link: "https://meet.link/xyz"
}
Full-Screen Mode

Add a button 🔳 Fullscreen to expand the editor to full window height and width.

Toggle back to normal view with 🗕 Exit Fullscreen.

🧪 UX Expectations
Tags like {{attendee_name}} should appear styled (e.g., light gray background).

Editing experience should be smooth with a toolbar and shortcuts.

Fullscreen mode should allow easier writing and previewing.

Content should be managed as HTML (TipTap handles this).

🧰 Tech Stack
React + TipTap

Styling: Tailwind CSS or basic CSS-in-JS

State management: useState

Optionally: use react-modal or Tailwind fixed + z-index for fullscreen

📁 Output
Deliver a React component named DescriptionEditor.jsx that:

Accepts initial content as prop

Exposes final HTML on change

Contains buttons/dropdowns for inserting tags/templates

Handles preview/fullscreen modes

✨ Bonus
Highlight invalid/missing tags in preview mode

Save/load templates from localStorage or server if needed
