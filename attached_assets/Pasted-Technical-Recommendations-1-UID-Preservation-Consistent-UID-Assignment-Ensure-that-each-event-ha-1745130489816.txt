Technical Recommendations
1. UID Preservation
Consistent UID Assignment: Ensure that each event has a unique and persistent UID throughout its lifecycle. This UID should remain unchanged during updates or cancellations.‚Äã

Centralized UID Management: Implement a centralized system to generate and manage UIDs, preventing duplication and ensuring consistency across different clients and sessions.‚Äã

2. Synchronization Mechanism
WebDAV-Sync Implementation: Utilize the WebDAV-Sync protocol extension to efficiently synchronize calendar data. This allows clients to request only the changes since the last sync, reducing overhead. ‚Äã

Sync Token Handling: Store and manage sync tokens provided by the server to track synchronization state. Handle scenarios where the server indicates the token is no longer valid by performing a full resynchronization.‚Äã

3. Event Lifecycle Management
SEQUENCE and LAST-MODIFIED Properties: Update the SEQUENCE number and LAST-MODIFIED timestamp appropriately with each event modification to help clients and servers determine the most recent version of an event.‚Äã

ETag Management: Ensure that the server returns an updated ETag for each event modification, allowing clients to detect changes and avoid conflicts.‚Äã

4. UI Handling During Sync
Optimistic UI Updates: Display events immediately upon creation or update in the UI, marking them as "pending" or "syncing" until confirmation from the server is received. This approach enhances user experience by providing immediate feedback.‚Äã

Background Synchronization: Perform synchronization operations in the background to prevent UI blocking or flickering. Utilize asynchronous operations and state management to handle sync statuses gracefully.‚Äã

5. Recurring Events and Exceptions
Proper Recurrence Handling: When dealing with recurring events, use the RRULE property to define the recurrence pattern and EXDATE to specify exceptions. For modifications to individual occurrences, utilize the RECURRENCE-ID property to identify and manage exceptions.‚Äã

Consistent UID for Recurrences: Maintain the same UID for all instances of a recurring event, differentiating exceptions using the RECURRENCE-ID.‚Äã

6. Email Notifications and Attachments
iCalendar Attachments: When sending email notifications, include the event details in the email body and attach the .ics file adhering to the iCalendar format. Ensure that the .ics file accurately represents the event, including attendees, resources, and recurrence information.‚Äã

PDF Generation: If providing PDF attachments, ensure they are generated accurately and reflect the event details consistently with the .ics file.‚Äã

üìö Reference Standards
