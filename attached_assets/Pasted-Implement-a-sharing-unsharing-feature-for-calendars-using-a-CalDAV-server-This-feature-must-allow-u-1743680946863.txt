Implement a sharing/unsharing feature for calendars using a CalDAV server. This feature must allow users to grant view-only or edit permissions to other users, as well as revoke these permissions.

Ensure that the CalDAV server supports sharing features or ACLs (Access Control Lists). Identify which HTTP methods (e.g., PROPPATCH, PUT, DELETE) are used for updating permissions.

Verify if any extensions (e.g., “calendar-schedule”) are required for handling sharing requests. Adjust the implementation based on the server’s capabilities.

Permission Levels:

View-Only: The shared user can only read calendar events.

Edit: The shared user can create, modify, or delete events.

Decide will be identified by email when permissions are assigned. Ensure consistency with how the CalDAV server expects to receive user identifiers.

Use an HTTP library for making requests to the CalDAV server.

Consider an XML parsing library for handling CalDAV responses.

If available, integrate a CalDAV client library to simplify interactions with the server.

Authentication:

Implement secure login using basic auth, OAuth, or the server’s supported authentication method.

Ensure secure storage and handling of credentials.

Connection Handling:

Write a module to establish and maintain sessions with the CalDAV server.

Retrieve and list the user’s calendars to allow selection for sharing.

User Interface (UI):

Design an interface (either CLI or a web UI) that allows users to:

Select a calendar to share.

Enter the recipient’s identifier (e.g., email address).

Choose the permission level: view-only or edit.

Constructing Sharing Requests:

For View-Only access, build a request that updates the calendar’s ACL to grant read access.

For Edit access, construct a request that updates the ACL to include write permissions.

Use the appropriate HTTP methods (e.g., PUT or PROPPATCH) as required by the CalDAV server.

Response Handling:

Parse the server’s response to verify that the ACL update was successful.

Provide immediate feedback in the UI regarding success or any errors encountered.

Unsharing (Revoking Permissions)
UI for Unsharing:

Allow users to:

Select a calendar that has shared permissions.

View a list of users who currently have access.

Select one or more users to revoke access.

Constructing Unsharing Requests:

Build a request that removes the ACL entry for the specified user(s).

Use the correct HTTP method (e.g., DELETE or an ACL-specific command) as dictated by the server.

Confirmation of Revocation:

Confirm that the server’s response indicates successful revocation.

Update the UI accordingly to reflect the removal of access.

Error Handling & Security Considerations
Error Management:

Handle network errors, authentication failures, and invalid requests.

Provide clear error messages in the UI to guide the user.

Security:

Securely manage and store authentication tokens/credentials.

Ensure all communication with the CalDAV server is over HTTPS.

Validate all user inputs to protect against injection and malformed request issues.

Unit Testing:

Develop tests for both the sharing and unsharing operations.

Include tests for view-only and edit permissions, as well as error scenarios (e.g., invalid user identifiers).

Integration Testing:

Test the complete flow from UI interaction to CalDAV server response in a staging environment.
